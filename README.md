# shotest-path-finding-using-obstacle-avoidance
With an increase in manufacturing and automation industries, we see a big requirement of work being done without any manual labour. This has resulted in a hunt for smart robots and smart robotics. An Obstacle Avoidance Robot is one such intelligent robot, which can automatically sense and overcome obstacles on its path. A robot in general may come across various types of obstacles – broadly categorized into static and dynamic obstacles. The start and the destination points of the robot are predetermined – just as it is in most applications of robotics and automation. We will implement a machine learning algorithm known as Deep Reinforcement Learning. Through this learning algorithm we allow the robot to learn and dynamically avoid potentially harmful obstacles. Hence we intend to find the shortest and best path from the start to the destination while preventing the robot from stumbling onto various obstacles.
